## Final Project

### Project Summary (To Be Written by Sheryl)

Our project will be centered around North American Cryptozoology. Choosing from either a selection or specific North Ameircan cryptid, our webpages will consist of an explantion and exploration of these cryptids. In detail we will explain where they come from, what they are, and why they may or may not be real.

### Core Webpages (To Be Written by Scotch)

The first page we will have will be a home webpage that lists all of our creatures on a map. The home page will also consist of a short explanations of what cryptozoology and cryptids are. We will also be providing a short description of why we chose these creatures on everyone's page. Scotch's two pages will be about "Mud Mermaids" and "The Kelly-Hopinskuns Monster". Sheryll's two pages will be about the "The Jersey Devil". Sunny's two pages will consist of the "Jackalope" and "Snallygaster". And Ada's two pages consist of the "Not Deer" and "The Snow Wasset".
