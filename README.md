## Final Project

### Project Summary (To Be Written by Sheryl)

Our project will be centered around North American Cryptozoology. Choosing from either a selection or specific North Ameircan cryptid, our webpages will consist of an explantion and exploration of these cryptids. In detail we will explain where they come from, what they are, and why they may or may not be real. We chose this topic after a quick discussion, and mainly chose it because of Scotch's pre-exisitng familiarity with the topic. Ada chose the Snow Wasset which lived by the Great Lakes and the Not Deer which was from Tennesee. I chose the Jersey Devil which is from New Jersey. Scotch did the 
Kelly-Hopinskinville monster which comes from Kentucky and the Mud Mermaid that comes from Pennsylvania.

### Key Takeaways (To Be Written by Ada)

One of the key reasons to work on this project is to gain an understanding for attributes that make a functional, clean, and educational website. Along with that, this is a great and simple way to show our understanding of course material in a realworld setting. Not only does this project work on our problem-solving skills, but it allows us to be creative. Choosing our own topic and design creates a bridge between creative problem-solving and technical problem-solving. Even working with others can lead to a better understanding of the industry we're about to enter. We gain an understanding of the importance of communicating with others along with the motivation to do our part of the project.

### Core Webpages (To Be Written by Scotch)

We will have all of our members pages in the nav, talking about each individual cryptid that we decided to do. Then we will have a home page which talks about what cryptids are, with a small gallery of examples of cryptids. On this page there will also be a button that will link you to a website that explains about cryptids more in depth. Then there will be a button that will take you to a random page done by our members.
