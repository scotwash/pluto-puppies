          The Snow Wasset is a large weasel that migrated between both Northern Canada as well as the Great Lakes region of the United States. Unlike most creatures, Snow Wasset's hibernate in the summer and are active in the winter. In the summer, they're described to have green fur and slower movements. However, during the winter, their fur is white, camouflaging with the snow. Their movements tend to speed up as well. During the winter, it sheds its legs and arms, giving them a worm-like shape. Small animals such as rabbits and possums tend to be their favorite meals. However, Snow Wassets are known to take down larger animals such as bobcats or wolves. They tend to have the temperment of a wolverine, known to be relatively aggressive.

          Its scientific name is Serpentoformus ferox. The Snow Wasset's meat is edible and safe to eat, even when raw. But unfortunately, the Snow Wasset, even when it's just a skeleton, comes back to life. They are know to be a migratory creature.
