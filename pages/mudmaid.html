      They were first described in a Pennsylvania newspaper, where they were described to be about four feet tall and "covered with light, chestnut-colored hair". They have yellowish skin and webbed feet at the end of their four limbs. Many sightings have slight variations but they are always described to have both humanoid and amphibious features. It is also said they make loud screeching noises when they are startled and they run and swim at high speeds. They are also said to have a diet of frogs and small fish.
