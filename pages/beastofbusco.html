          Jeresy devil stands amoung some of the most infamous cryptids in North
          American folklore. As its name implies the Jersey Devil features huge
          bat like wings along its back as well as clawed hands and a forked
          tail. Uniquely however The Jersey Devil is said to have a face similar
          to both a dog and a horse, as well as mighty horns that many artists
          have interpreted as Deer Antlers.

          The Jersey Devil has had many interpretations and renditions over the
          decades since its first sightings. While the cryptids general shape
          and musculature are similar among depictions, its indiviual details
          are often extremely differnet between artists. Likewise it is extremly
          difficult to determine what the Jersery Devil couldve looked like with
          any degree of accuracy, However this hasnt prevented many artists from
          trying regardless.
