        <p>
          Unlike other North American Cryptids few distinguishing features of
          the Beast of Busco exist. Its body, while obscenely large is identical
          to that of a Snapping turtle. Disticnivly characterized by its dry
          skin and sharp beak.

        <h2 id="heading-jersey">Story</h2>
        <p>
          The tales of the Beast of Busco are as interesting as they are often
          vauge. Legeneds exist of a man named Oscar Fulk, a farmer who failed
          to capture the beast after he saw it in his lake. In modern times
          however the story of this beast takes a different turn. Late at night
          in 1948, 2 fisherman found the huge turtle as they arose from the
          lake. Many other townsfolk came to see and while the turtle left back
          into the lake the town of Churubusco became surrounded by the national
          media. This creature is also especially important due to its nature as
          one of the few if only nationally recognized cryptids for the state of
          Indiana.

        <h2 id="heading-jersey">Depictions</h2>
        <p>
          Few depictions of this creature exist due to its relative obscruity
          compared to other crytids as well as its generally boring nature as
          simply a large snapping turtle. However many artists use their
          artistic abilites to present the cryptid in a more aggrevise manor
          giving it aspects like spikes, even rougher skin, and pointed shell.
