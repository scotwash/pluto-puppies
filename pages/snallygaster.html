          The Snallygaster is described as a half-reptile, half-bird like
          creature with a metallic beak, razor sharp teeth, and long octopus
          like tendrils. It was rumored to swoop down from the sky and snatch up
          it's victims to feast upon them and their blood. It was seen being
          described as being a giant beast with wings, pointed bill, steel
          claws, and a singular eye on it's forehead. It's been sighted as far
          back as the 18th century and as recently as the 20th.

          The Snallygaster originally originated from superstitions german
          immigrants and was called the Schneller Geist, or Quick Ghost. They
          are said to also be able to be warded off with Seven pointed stars.
          Which can still be seen on barns around the area to ward it off
          livestock.
