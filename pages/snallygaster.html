          The Snallygaster is described as a half-reptile, half-bird like
          creature with a metallic beak, razor sharp teeth, and long octopus
          like tendrils, mostly commonly sighted in Maryland. It was rumored to
          swoop down from the sky and snatch up it's victims to feast upon them
          and their blood. It was seen being described as being a giant beast
          with wings, pointed bill, steel claws, and a singular eye on it's
          forehead. It's been sighted as far back as the 18th century and as
          recently as the 20th.

          The Snallygaster originally originated from superstitions german
          immigrants and was called the Schneller Geist, or Quick Ghost. They
          are said to also be able to be warded off with Seven pointed stars.
          Which can still be seen on barns around the area to ward it off
          livestock.

          It was also described to have made screeching like sounds, similiar to
          that of a train whistle. The Snallygaster is also classified as a
          Feresome critter alongside the Jackalope.

          U.S. President Theodore Rosevelt supsosedly was rumored to have nearly
          postponed the African safari to personally hunt the beast after the
          Smithsonian institution offered a rewards for the beast's hide.
          Another cryptid by the name of the Dewayo was reported to be the
          Snallygaster's known enemy. The Snallygaster was also depicted in the game Fallout 76.
