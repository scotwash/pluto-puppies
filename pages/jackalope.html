          The Jackalope is a mythical creature described as a Jackrabbit with
          Antelope horns. They originated as a cryptid from Wyoming in the 1930s
          when two hunter brothers decided to taxidermy and graft antlers onto a
          Jackrabbit which they sold to people. However there were sightings of
          them as far back as the 1820s and art depictions of them dated as far
          back as 1575 in Europe, Asia, and Africa.

          The Jackalope is so popular in Wyoming that the Wyoming Legislature
          has considered making bills to pass the Jackalope as the states
          offical mythological creature. The first Jackalope head made by the
          brothers was sold for 10 dollars and then stolen in 1977 and hasn't
          been found since. Artist renditions of them have been seen in shows
          and games such as Scooby Doo, Gravity Falls, Red Dead, and My Singing
          Monsters.

          They are seen by Folklorists as Tall Tales creatures, also known as
          Fearsome critters. They most commonly are described in tall tales
          along side other similiar beasts like hodags, fur trout, and giant
          snakes.

          The Jackalope is believed by some to be spotting a Jackrabbit with the
          Shope papilloma virus, Which causes horn like growths to sprout from
          animal's head. The Jackalope is also recorded as an offical SCP in the
          SCP database as SCP-7134.
