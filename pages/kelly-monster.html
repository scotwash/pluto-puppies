      <p id="description-intro">Description:</p>
      <p id="kelly-intro">The Kelly-Hopkinsville Monster was first found in 1955 near Kelly and Hopinskinville in Christian County in 1955.</p>
     
      
  
        <p id="kelly-desc"> On the evening of August 21, 1955, five adults and seven children claimed that small creatures from a spaceship attacked their farm; they claimed they were in a gunfight with these creatures for a few hours. However when neaby sheriffs investigated the matter, they were unable to find anything other than bullet holes that were found in the doors and windows. It is believed by many to be one of the most significant UFO citings, while others believe it was a simple meteor or owl sighting that was misindentified.</p>
